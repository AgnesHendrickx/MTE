Parameters
==========

| Certain limitations are present when attempting to replicate any shape through a discretized domain, which can potentially lead to inaccuracies in the computed values. For precise and optimal anomaly computations over varied topographies, it is crucial to initially establish certain domain parameters. These include identifying the minimum quantity of elements necessary for a accurate representation of volcanic terrain, and determining the minimal domain size to mitigate the impact of the edge effect. 
| This edge effect, which occurs at the boundaries of the simulated domain, emerges from the cutoff at the periphery, generating its own unique magnetic anomaly. Our goal is to minimize this edge effect while also managing the absolute dimensions and resolution of the domain to ensure computational efficiency and reduce the time and effort required. 
| These parameters were determined using a domain with synthetic topography, the southern flank setup as outlined in the section :ref:`flank simulations <flanksim>`, because employing a DEM limits certain parameters. Furthermore, the test were repeated for a setup of simple box (:ref:`benchmark 2a <B2>` without internal perturbation), however not all test can be adequately repeated (see section resolution). The experiments were conducted along a path elevated 1 meter above the ground, representing the minimum elevation level for most field sites. Since the lowest elevation necessitates the largest resolutions and domain size, this setup will establish the threshold. 
|
| It remains unclear whether the parameters defined through these tests can be directly correlated with the thresholds needed for calculations over topographies derived from a DEM. The real topographical variations on Mount Etna are anticipated to encompass larger and more intricate structures. Larger structures could potentially induce greater anomalies, which might extend farther, given that the magnitude of a magnetic anomaly generated by an entity is directly proportional to its physical properties (volume or weight) and is moderated by the distance, as noted in :cite:`GRIFFITHS`. Consequently, a reevaluation of these parameters will be essential in upcoming DEM examinations.
| 
| Please note that the illustrations displayed here showcase only a fraction of the numerous tests executed to ascertain the necessary parameters and highlight significant discoveries.

Resolution
----------
| The resolution experiments will initiate at a high resolution, gradually reducing the number of elements. We anticipate identifying a threshold where any further reduction would lead to incorrect values. Understanding the manifestation of these errors is instrumental in identifying them in other intricate setups, particularly when using the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). 
|
| All these tests maintained a consistent domain size of 50x50x120 meters. The expanded depth range was selected to minimize the interference from the bottom surface. To analyze its effect, some tests were conducted with a doubled domain depth of 240 meters, marked as "DD" configurations.
| Variations in the number of elements were explored in both the x and y directions, fluctuating within a range of 10 to 75 elements. The two lowest resolutions examined generate elements that are identical in size to those used in the DEM tests.
| Regarding the adjustments in the number of elements in the depth dimension, it is expected that this would not impact the outcomes. Theoretically, all internal forces should negate each other, meaning that increasing this quantity would primarily extend the computation duration. Nonetheless, this hypothesis was examined through repeated experiments.
| The tests were repeated for the setup of a box, however, we expect to observe no changes in the outcomes, as subdividing the flat top surface into multiple surfaces would only increase computation time.

| :numref:`restestcomp` presents the findings of the resolution tests. As predicted by theory, the amount of elements in the z-direction does not affect the outcomes. For all subsequent tests, the amount of elements in the z-direction will be maintained at 10. 
| In the xy-directions, allocating half an element per meter proves to be marginally adequate, with only minor deviations noted. When the resolution is reduced further, a distinctive pattern emerges; the computed values first exhibit instability at the highest slope, indicated by abrupt fluctuations in what was previously a smooth progression. Future tests will aim to maintain a standard of 1.5 elements per meter, wherever feasible, while staying observant of these distinctive errors. 
| Furthermore, :numref:`restestcomp` indicates that the depth extent of the domain does not alter the observed trends stemming from insufficient resolution, but instead generates a shift in the magnetic field strength.
| It should be noted that a curved surface is particularly hard to accurately represent with hexahedron elements, hence, another arbitrary shape might require much less resolution to produce adequate results. This can be seen in :numref:`restestbox`, where the amount of elements has no impact on the results for a constant domain size.

Size 
----
| The size experiments will commence with a more compact domain and progressively expand it until the computed magnetic field at a point above the domain center stabilizes. The outcomes of changes in both the depth extent (z-direction) and spatial extent (xy-direction) will be analyzed, maintaining element resolution consistent with the previously established threshold at observation points along a line 1 meter above the surface. 
|
| However, upon adapting domain depth, a complication surfaces: the exact nature of the magnetization in the underlying flows and deeper is unknown. Nonetheless, we continue to assume a uniform magnetization. This assumption now expands deeper, eventually stretching to the full pile of volcanic flows of Mount Etna. To validate this assumption, we refer to the geomagnetic history of Mount Etna. The last reversal of Earth's magnetic field was dated around :math:`\sim795` ka ago :cite:`Singer19` and the first volcanic activity of Mount Etna was dated around :math:`\sim500` ka ago :cite:`Branca08`. 
| Therefore, no reversals are anticipated within the accumulated layers, allowing us to extend the depth for experimental purposes without restrictions. Nonetheless, as the directly underlying flow is deemed to exert the most substantial influence, expanding the depth beyond a singular flow might be redundant. The thickness of the flows underneath the field sites mentioned in :cite:`Meyer23` fluctuate between 5-15 meter :cite:`Andro05, Mur00`. 
| Consequently, our tests explore domain depth ranging from 10 to 140 meter. When it comes to spatial extent, no additional consideration are necessary, and so our experiments span a spatial extent from 50 to 1000 meters.

| In the investigations presented in :numref:`box_low`, spatial extents below 250x250 meters prominently display edge effects. This is particularly evident for the :math:`B_y` component, which should ideally measure zero in the absence of topography or declination in magnetization. A uniform value across the observation path indicates the absence of edge effects, whereas variable values correlate with proximity to the domain edge.

| Our data reveals a nuanced relationship between the depth extent of the domain and the anomaly's intensity, as evident in both :numref:`box_low` and :numref:`box_high_dif`. Notably, for components :math:`B_x` and :math:`B_z`, magnitude increases with depth in a non-linear fashion. An initial increase in depth (10 to 600 meters) yields a significant change in component values, but a subsequent increase from 600 to 1200 meters sees marginal differences. This relationship also depends on spatial extent. For instance, 500x500x40 and 250x250x20 meter configurations produce identical :math:`B_x` and :math:`B_z` values. Observations unveil three distinct patterns, see :numref:`box_high_dif`:

1. Identical values arise when both depth and spatial extent increase equivalently (e.g., 250x250x20 and 500x500x40 meters).
2. Increasing spatial extent alone reduces the magnitude proportionally (e.g., 250x250x20 and 500x500x20 meters).
3. Amplifying depth alone enhances the magnitude consistently (e.g., 250x250x20 and 250x250x40 meters or 500x500x20 and 500x500x40 meters).

| It is important to highlight that the inclination values are consistent across different setups, given that the modulating factor for both :math:`B_x` and :math:`B_z` remains identical.

| We adopted the 3D Gauss-Legendre quadrature rules to numerically determine the volume integral (referenced in :eq:`eq.10_2`).

| Determining the optimal setup poses challenges. While increasing domain size might intuitively stabilize computed values, :numref:`extestcomp`, :numref:`box_low` and :numref:`box_high_dif` contradict this presumption. While consistent depth expansion appears to eventually plateau the results, increasing depth continues to influence the magnitudes of the :math:`B_x` and :math:`B_z` components, as illustrated in various depth configurations with a spatial layout of 250x250 in :numref:`box_low`. Moreover, when comparing deeper configurations like 500x500x1800 with 500x500x20 meters in :numref:`box_low`, a pronounced amplification of edge effects for the :math:`B_y` component is evident. This trend aligns with recommendations from the foundational study by :cite:`Bott63`, suggesting that optimal results emerge when the depth is substantially less than the areal extent.
| 
| Nevertheless, this observation does not offer clarity in distinguishing between configurations of shallower depths but varied spatial dimensions, such as 250x250x10, 250x250x20, 500x500x20, and 500x500x40 meters. Still, by examining :numref:`extest_comp_mp_high`, it becomes apparent that magnitude differences for these setups are minimal when juxtaposed with anomalies caused by domain topography.
| Most importantly, when values from a box with corresponding dimensions are subtracted from the topographic simulation values, the discrepancies nearly converge into a single solution, see :numref:`topo_box`. The residual minor fluctuations in the :math:`B_x` components across domains of different sizes are likely due to the incline of the topography simulation, given that a box is merely subtracted from the southern slope simulation which ascends northward. 
| This study's focal point is the influence of topography on magnetic field readings above a flow, thus, this subtraction technique is adequate for alleviating complications linked to domain size and the magnitude of the resultant anomaly. A key takeaway is that maintaining a spatial size above or equal to 250x250 meter, where the depth is considerably less than the spatial dimension, is crucial. However, future investigations must judiciously consider both depth and spatial extent.

Bottom boundary
---------------
| One last issue to contemplate, is the shape of the bottom of the mesh. The topography on the bottom can be simulated in two ways: 

1. use the same topography as the top surface
2. produce a flat bottom. 


.. _sb_fb:
.. figure:: figures/sb_fb_250_250_20.png
   :class: with-border

   The resulting mesh using either the same topography as the top surface (on the right) or a flat bottom (on the left) for the setup as outlined in :ref:`flank simulations <flanksim>`.

| See :numref:`sb_fb` for the visualization of the different options. 

| 
| As our computational solution is a surface integral and the interior contributions should cancel out, we can understand the possible repercussion of this predicament. Neither is an accurate representation of reality and from theory we know the effect could be significant. Therefore, the differences need to be investigated and both methods will be used and compared.  
| 


| It should be noted that the flat bottom setup of the :ref:`flank simulations <flanksim>` is different from the :doc:`etna`. For :ref:`flank simulations <flanksim>` the input value for depth of the domain is added in the middle of the domain (exactly below the observation path) to the topography simulated by the slope and sine wave (see :py:func:`support.topography`). In this fashion, when testing using a flat bottom, the chosen depth value actually relates to the depth value underneath the path regardless of other parameters of the domain (desirable for parameter testing). However, as the slope and wave topography is also anchored in the middle of the domain, it is possible to create a setup where the base of the flat bottom intersects with the surface topography. An example: run base setup for flank simulations with domain size of 250x250x10m. Even though this intersection happens at a significant distance from the path, the results are not tested or verified and this situation should be avoided. 
| To avoid this situation, in :doc:`etna`, the depth of the domain is added to the lowest value of the surface topography from the DEM. However, this does result in varying depth extent underneath the path depending on the spatial extent of the section of the DEM used.
